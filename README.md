This project used Adafruit's LIS3DH and Unified Sensor Arduino Libraries.   
In addition, we used this: <https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32> so we could work with a STM32401RE     
We also used LiquidCrystal I2C by Frank de Brabander, John Rickman and other contributors: <https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C>
